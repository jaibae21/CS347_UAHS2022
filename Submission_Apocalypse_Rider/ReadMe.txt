A 2d platform game where a person on a motorcycle fights through mummies while avoiding traps and navigating the terrain. 

Implemented: 
Pool A: Sprite Animation, sounds
Pool B: Simple AI (on the enemies)
Game challenges: 4 levels of varying difficulty 

Player Controls: 
Space = jump
Arrow keys for movement (up will jump too)
Q = shoot
P = Pause Menu
	Contains option to restart, resume, and exit


(For presentation/debugging/developer controls)
Swap levels with the number keys 1-4 ( with 4 for now pausing since we have no GUIs)
R = restart the level if you fall off screen
Known Bugs/Issues:
*If you fall off screen, you just fall. (Ran out of time to add in that part/also just forgot)
*shoot animation is visually delayed (some timing thing probably)
	Can shoot two bullets within the span of the animation
*Shoot sfx delay also seems to be a timing thing
	Can fire two bullets within the span of the sfx
*Pause menu might be a bit buggy
