the starting level has a specific music track, and so players will discuss how the track reminds them of that level

**Tetrad con**
	Visuals: box art, loading screens, can be used as anti piracy method, i.e you wont see something and can't continue 
		can have multiple mediums 
		rastoration: view port of 3d model made into pixels
	Sound: sound effects draw you into the world more, instanteously deliever information 
		dialogue: concrete, fast, can help you really get a point across
		Music
	Touch, Smell, and Taste: more common in table top games and such, however rumble controllers better for approximate information gives idea to if you're doing something correctly
		Touch doesn't get annoying if used to give same signal over and over again
	Aesthic Goals: Mood: faster but more delicate than mechanics, no objective logical theory 
		Information: boss tracks, fictional states such as motifs popping up for a certain scenerio 
Inscribed Narrative: 
Follows same way you would break it down in an English class
	Components: premise, setting, character, and plot
	Dramatics: 
		Traditional Structure: Five act, important climax happens right in the middle, follows a typical story
		Three Act: built around one single climax, built around single protagonist so when they do something exciting you also feel excited, gives you a kinda expectation since setup is "boring", inciting incident is where the characters everyday life is disrupted, 1st plot point something you can't return from; can apply to dialogue, actions etc
			typically the 3 acts happen in a different location 
			Act 2: "road of trials"
			Act 3: hit their lowest point, then revelation = climax, 
				denoumont is super fast, kinda like welp you did you the end 
		Ja-Ha-Kyu: very quick, think cowboy stand off, quick reload, useful for animation 
	Interactive vs Linear: main plot vs side quests
		beads on a string: preserve illusion of control, choices that feel different. Two options that split and then reconvene, reference something that happens later helps give the illusion 
	character vs Avatar: Character already exists in the game world; avatar is created, you are nameless
	Narrative Goals: emotional evokeness, motivation and justification like a scale exchanging freedom of backstory for justification, reinforce the mechanics (abstract),
Inscribed Technology:
Dynamic behavior, strong interplay with mechanics

**Dynamic Layer**
-Player Role: dynamic layer doesn't exist without, player feels things at different times which influences time of game, different reasons for sitting down and starting a game (emotional motivation) which introduces chaos, introduce atypical mentalities 
-Emergence: can be previewed with playtest, 
-Mechanics:
	buttons you press, decisions
	meaningful play: integrated andrognously meaningful-meaninful actions needed for engagement 
	strategy: cuts down on number of decisions needed to make to reach goal, optimal strategy exists for any pursuit of a goal, no goal is standard play, brain power for said strategy? 
		first order optimal: they are not bad, easy way to get feet wet for like an mmo but want to make sure to ween people off of it. 
		too much design for strategic play creates a barrier to entry to playing the game like with fighter games with mulitple combos 
		depth with fighter games is like adding new characters to the roster with different skills 
		complexity is inscribed, brute force
	house rules: culture house rule-one hitting and running and letting time run out (winning by technacality) 
		Aram becoming a thing
	player intent: 
	
	
Aesthic:
	Composite: things created as result of independent systems
	Procedural: more purposeful, inverse kinematics: say where you want a foot to be and it auto calculates angle and what not
		tesselation: getting farther from something reduces the detail you can see
	environmental: not game but environment around player, changing game for disabilities,
