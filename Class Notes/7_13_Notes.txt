** From final review ** 
Iterative Design(7): 
	Identify essential questions and skills
	given scenerio or phase find important item and way to do it
		sci fi fps, which question should we use for the preproduction phase
			what prior art exists, then go look
	Implementation: discern between refinement and efficiency 
		efficieny is over long period of time how long can you spend comformtably working on something
		refinement quality of product that comes out from the work and hours you put in
	Innovation: what is incremental and intersectional 
		handheld to console - graphical level incremental: already knew graphics and improve
		multiple monsters on map but only go for target but sequel could ride non target to get target on - intersectional: solves how to have players engage in the other monsters on the field
	Brainstorming: 
		generate ideas, collect them, collide them to create intersectional innovations that address multiple ideas at once
		find best innovations then combine into game
	Production Process: core idea - changing your mind
		need mind to change at beginning of process 
		prepoduction - figure out what game will be and who sell to 
			vertical slice ends process: highly polished, what you show to backers or players as a playable demo
		production: bringing most labors onto the project
		alpha build: still has some bugs but doesn't need content created for it 
		beta: suitable for mass release but still bugs you should remove to improve quality and still some niche things you might want to improve
		gold: not really in today, wanted a game for a console, you'd have to send game to console maker and get approval for it to be made
			post-release: adding patches and fixing bugs, DLCs
	Scoping: making sure scope of what you can accomplish with resources match with scope of game you are creating
		mismatch = under deliver or over promise on content
Design Goals: 
	what game do for people who play it 
	small group of highly invested fans or large group of semi invested
	greater good: divulge info to player, incentivize people to do good things like excercise
	flow band:
		understand what game is doing and how you're tackling it
		clear and immediate feedback, expression of skill causes challenge to be overcome
	Structed Conflict
		brains problem solving machines, we optimize ourselves within rules
		structured lets us skip to optimize and we get gratification as we feel we are improve,
	Autotelic enpowerment
		decide what you want to do, when, what world looks like
		correlated with people enjoying flow
	Performative
		giving player ability to make beautiful play
		large degree of design space to player improvisation
		be able to tell difference in autotelic and performative
	Attention and involvement
		attention: reflexive act of paying attention to something that grabs your interest
		involvement: voluntary engagement to something that gives you return on something
			feeling of improvement on something, understand more of a game
		follow an interest curve the same as 3 act structure
		4 elements of tetrad can be mapped onto what gives executive and reflexive gratification
		technology typically replaced with community
	Interesting decisions
		make them quickly or important ones
		given a decision tell why it isn't interesting
		discernable: be able to tell that it did something
		integrated: game needs to show that the input has been recognized
		ambiguous: know that the decision impacted the game and be excited about the possibilitys and not know what is gonna happen
		double edged: more than one correct option, have difficulty weighing them
		novel: decision needs to be different from those that came before
			very engagin combat system but combat for 40hrs straight will get boring
		clear: broadly predictable consequences
	Experiential Understanding
		back half of personal expression and communication
		some want to communicate things through art others want to experience things through art
		this is the gratification of those people through player centric goals



** Design Goals **
Designer centric:
Fame and fortune is harder to come by in this industry 
Gaming community is large and you can form a social base if you can communitcate what's needed 
	Life goals developers have
		making money
		Fame
			social equivalent of making money
			want name out there and recognized for a certain quality or feature of a game
			harder to achieve in videogame industry bc its much more collaborative 
				also the limited technology to make one on your own
	Community 
		create art around which a group of interested people will congregate
			can draw in everyone or a specific closed group of people
		community is promoted by breadth of access or difficulty of access
		secrets, lore, and strong artistic direction enable ease of community growth 
	Personal Expression and Communication
		particular emotion we want other people to understand
			give idea that you would do actions of monstrotity given the circumstance
		forms of media for this concept and form of media adept at using is when this arises for videogames 
	Greater good
		use games to increase quality of life
			workout, typing
		raise awareness or broaden perspectives 
		behavirol change
			better at to-do lists
	Better Designer
		
Player Centric
Engagement in form of fun magic circle, lusory attitude 
	game gives experience of something that is enjoyable (below is whats needed to be enjoyable)
		joy of competition (agon)
			player vs player or player vs environment
		interacting with random evnets (alea)
			different pokemon encounters
		excitement of vertigo (illinx) 
			rollercoaster, skydiving, spinning real fast in a room 
			flight or fight 
		predict something will happen and it happens (mimicry)
			civilaztion game
	Engaging 
		mental investment = androgous power
		fun or funny to engage in 
			nice animation, things you didn't expect
	Fulfillment 
		Stimulation
		Socialization
		Community 
		Precarious form because it can be gated off leading to unethical design choices
			paying more money, holding emotional engagement hostage
	Lusory Attitude 
		law abiding attitude towards pursuing game 
		helps buy into the fiction of the game world
	Magic Circle
		maintain lusory attitude for long enough
		state of max immersion 
			only thinking in terms of game
				ex poker, all about bluffing, betting 
		pauses in immersion cause the magic circle to deteriorate
			doesn't immediately outright break
	Flow 
		discrete psychological state
		feeling totally focused (in the zone) 
		typical for rhythm, back and forth movement games
			causes constant input of skill
		when so many hours pass, tunnel vision
		metally fatiguing
			typically can only be in flow for 20 mins 
		player skill needs to be almost matched by the game's challenges 
		achieved a lot in action games, 
		need to experiecne it as and ebb and flow type thing so you don't get bored and put down the game
		find the skill ceiling, then estimate where to bring it down and back up to get flow
		Pursue flow in a clean way
			optional extreme difficulty
			
Psychological gratification
Focus for interesting curves, decisions 
Small set of goals limits and focuses design 
Many goals broaden and stabilize the design 
	more money need to make, more designs you pursue
