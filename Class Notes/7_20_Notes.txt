** From final review ** 
use qualifiers for good or bad puzzle to determine what needs to be changed based on feedback
pick genre of a puzzle and what its best practices are that you could use
abnegation def
identify modalities
be able to tell what happens in each step of puzzle design or which ones are out of order

** Puzzle Design (13) ** 
Puzzle is fun and has a correct answer both parts neccessary
fun no answer: more like a toy (goat sim, play around and cause destruction)
correct answer no fun: like a quiz, feels like execution is being challenged
focus is on mental challenges not fast reflexes
	Make it fun
		Novelty:
			process of taking in the information, rules etc, you think about puzzle and stop when you have a flash inspiration about how to think or solve, and after the puzzle is solved
			puzzle often requires flash of insight before solved
			magnitude of uniqueness of inspiration is the novelty 
				overwatch: need to move port for controller to get past a part
			riddles, trick, questions: become devoid of content after novelty experienced
				such as playing again
			if you need a puzzle solved over and over again
				add execution, reflex, or communication components to the design which determines input for the solution
		Trickiness:
			players come with a certain conception of standard play to a puzzle
				use this against the player to make it trickier
			too tricky and the player will feel as though their understanding of the game is not being rewarded
				doing something you usually do for an entire game and it changing for something else
					normal turn based game that turns into actual control of character for boss
					makes skills you've built over gameplay seem pointless
			not tricky enough will have obvious solution
			examine preconceptions from the puzzle itself and not the entire game to gauge trickiness of puzzle
				don't think you do this many times in game, so it should be obvious this is what you should do now
		Appropriate Difficulty
			puzzle match the player's skill, experience, and creativity
			players perceive puzzle to be simple, less likely to give up
			add medium difficulty standard solution or high difficulty advanced solution if this puzzle is important to the game
			hints scattered throughout game world
	Conveying right answer
		need at least one correct answer and its intuitive to the player
			movement based can have multiple correct answers
		most games present puzzles as physical objects so that solutions are easily verifiable and intuitive
			being able to move through a door
			if not physical, use dialog or indicator of what you intend for the player to accomplish
	Genres of Puzzles
		Action
			real time and typically includes physical movement
			conventions: 
				simple rules with time pressure
					bejeweled
				clear and obvious indicators of success/failure
			best practice: 
				allow players to make mistakes since we are dealing with time constraints
				make proximity to failure condition clear
		Story
			require player to understand a fictional happening and intuit hidden information
			Conventions:
				difficulty modulated through number of characters and media
				revolve around a who dun it or hidden object puzzle
			Best practices:	
				allow players to revisit old information
				obvious incorrect answers to hone deductive skills
					makes some puzzles easier
					helps player gain an intuition of what isn't a correct answer, which can be used later in the game
		Construction
			Player given set of building blocks and create mechanism
			creating some product, understanding how its done is how you gain mastery
			Convention
				some product from reagants
				require certain number of products made in a row to avoid FOO strategies
					ensures a stable creation
			Best Practices
				show solution as a shadowed version, name of what want accomplished
				placing and moving items should both be impermanent and cheap
					need to be able to use trial and error
					lets them insert something back at a different step that they may have forgotten
				these practices are about avoidning frustrations
		Strategy
			make series of moves where each has consequences long term
				chess puzzle 
			Conventions
				take existing game and have solution obtained
				limit time or move count which puts pressure to consider long term consequences of what you're doing
			Best Practices
				allow forward/backward buttons to allow players to scrub through their sequence
					be able to start back at an intermediate step, like a checkpoint type thing
				remove pieces or options that might distract the player
					shadow illegal moves
					allows players to get right to the decision making
	Why ppl play Puzzles
		challenge
			overcoming structed challenge is fun
				sudoku puzzles
		abnegation
			allows mind to rest by occupying it with low load tasks
			allows you recuperate faster from something more mentally taxing
		Character/Environment
			following some story/journey that involves puzzles
		spiritual journey
			very dubious
			some puzzles act as rights of passage and mimick hero's journey
			come back from puzzles being more knowledgable in how to solve them
	How they play
		modality is the format in which the puzzle is presented and part of brain it excercises
		three singular modalities that combine into multi-modality puzzles
			clue
		Word
			understand meaning, spelling, composition of words
			riddles, crossword
		Image
			processing, relating, understanding images
			jigsaw
		Logic
			deduction type, field of possiblities and finding viable answer
			clue
		mixed modality integrate two or more
			scrabble (word/image), riddles and puns (word/logic), sliding block mazes and lazer mazes (image/logic)
	How we Design Puzzles
		inspiration
			generate idea for puzzle by finding interesting subject or pattern
			figure out what your puzzle is about
		simplification
			take idea and isolate core mechanice, simplify controls
		construction set
			what makes the puzzle
			figure out how to make constructing puzzles quick and easy
		rules
			define and clarify them
			make them easily communicated
		puzzles
			generate whole bunch of puzzles, making as many different ones, valid approaches, variety of objective styles, end goals
		testing
			get feedback, refine teaching tools, figure difficulty 
		sequence
			use principle of sequencing to introduce puzzle concepts
		presentation
			refine visuals, interface, other media used to present puzzle to improve aesthetic appeal
	How know puzzle is good
		User friendly
			approachable and rewarding
			tricky and not obtuse
		ease of entry
			what they need to do and what they want to do
			understand victory condition, tools they can use, and give general direction towards completing
		instant feedback
			react to player in way that is aesthitcally pleasing and little time delay
		perputal motion
			puzzle solved, player should have good time with it and want to solve another of same type
		clear goals
			goals required to complete puzzle should be clear
			part of user friendly
			can have advanced goals hidden from player
		difficulty level
			challenges (inscribed and cultural layer) should be modulated to match skills of new or advanced players
		je ne sais quoi
			"I don't know how to describe"
			something sets game apart in players mind, a type of hook
			lead player to think about game outside
	Common Puzzle games
		sliding blocks
		physics puzzles
			novel and can be tricky
		traversal
			action puzzles, requiring series of inputs
		stealth
			2d or 3d field that are forbidden at certain times
		chain reactions
			puzzles based on novelty spectacle, send car into traffic causing explosions
		boss fights
	Summary
		puzzle design is not large departure from typical game development
		shift moment to moment play for flashes of insight, larger dose of delayed gratification
		core intrigue is the resolution of uncertainty
		should use iterative design


** Lenses of Players, Puzzles, Playtesting ** 
maps a lense to particular player, puzzle or in playtesting
	Player
	understand who players are and what they want
	how do we appeal to them
	understand the product exists and is for them
		Male
			mastery, grading system on how well someone does
			competition, player and some other entity in competition for some goal
			destruction
				things in environment can be destroyed, reshaped
					battlefield
			spatial puzzles
				understand how something is 2d or 3d oriented in space and use knowledge to achieve specific condition
			trial and error
				instead of perfect all at once approach problem iteratively, allowing failure
					precision platform genre
					speed running - sort of giant trial and error
		Female
			emotion
				create stories that hook players emotionally
				pay off emotions in satisfying ways
				allow cathersis
				emotional validation for how we believe something should work
			make it about real world and gamify it
				sims - have wants, needs, go about world doing random things, is reminicinse 
			nurturing
				long term form of progression
				farmville style game
				stardew valley/harvest moon
			dialogue/verbal
				logic and words excersie those parts of brain
			learning by example
				initial indication of how user should start instead of kind of thrown in and needing to it all at once
		Pleasing Players
			particular base things we can include that really activates someone's brain
			way to add reflexive attention grabbing elements
			sensation
				whatever shown in game is a novel and fulfilling sensation, appealing
					casting fireball, channels and then shoot out rather than just a wand
					destiny 2, WoW: reload animation, spell casting
			fantasy
				player can envision themselves as something they wish to be
				deliever on a fantasy and it becomes more fun
			narrative
				elements of game all serve a purpose
				small part of bigger whole
			fellowship
				ecnounter people that give sense of fellowship and belonging, base social
			discovery
				indulge in curiosity gives rewards long term or short term
					Legend of Zelda: corox seeds that grant cumulative long term progress
			expression
				sneaky, agressive, cold-reserved, social: make all viable ways players can interact if it applies in game
			submission
				abnegation applied to mechanic
				knowing something will work and come through for you
			enough quality in primary appeal you get secondary appeal
				side effects of well primary appeal
				can try and make it upfront
				anticpation
					when something momentous is going to happen. give it enough buildup 
						foreshadowing for story arc
				completion
					can achievably get the tasks complete, give reward
				shard n frouda 
					enjoy watching others suffer
				generosity
					people can help other people
					MMO: give money to starter player
				humour
					game is funny and fun to interact with
					short form, improvisational
					identifying pattern and subverting or twisting expectations
				possibility
					anything they want to do is possible
					open world with discoverable content
				pride
					accomplish something difficult then showcase that
				give following emotion that is difficult to provide in real life
					surprise
					thrill
					triumph 
						long term goal
					wonder
						be overwhelmed by artistic expression
	Puzzles
	things that stop player and make them think
	suffer from unrepeatability
	delay gratification
		Hint at solvibilty through progress
			don't have puzzle sit until finished, have it be incrememntal
			phsycially seeing how far you are will embolden you
		Use perspective shifts sparingly and exhibit parallism 
			make it so player be able to parse presentation of game logically
		Pyramid Structure to invoke interest
			hierachal model of what people want out of life, satisfy one moves up layer
			physiological
				getting out of danger situations
			safety, social, esteem,
			self actualization
	Playtesting
		genres of user involved group
			focus group
				representative sample group
			quality testing
				people skilled at pluming possibility spaces
			usability
				given interface perform tasks
			in general playtest
				give target audience game and record subjective reactions
		playtest questions
			why
				how different demographics approach game
				emergence is succeed by ...
				ensure replayability
				curate experiences
					basic quality assurance of artistic vision behind game that results in subjective experience
				fine tune way player navigates game
					games heavily based on movement so that it feels inuitive
				find and remove difficulty spikes
			who
				developers who can also understand how games designed
				friends who can criticize without endangering relationship
				experts accomplished in other games similar to yours
				fresh meat people who have no experience with your game, most accurately represent mass market
			where
				different locations because environment affects different aesthetics
				development place
					easy to get all members of team present to watch, comment, and give discplianry look
				playtest lab
					devoid of distractions, controlled environment
				public venues
				playtester house
					take home to most accurately simulate how it will be enjoyed 
				online
					max hardware being used
			what play test for
				look for specific experiences that we are expecting
				find things not looking for
					game implifications are properly sent out
				emotional reaction
				player mechanical
			how
				preserve feedback and don't bias player
				prime player as little as possible to get genuine reaction
				record body language and facial expression
				auto record data
				player disturbance policy
					what needs to happen in the game for a developer to step in


** Lens of Stories and Characters **
	Stories
		neccessatate different story approach from other media
		beads on a string
			two small forks in road that reconvene on same path later
		story machine
			create independent narrative elements in world
			player can interact how they choose
			player made story arises
			try to generate story telling world and system that allows elements to build on each other
			premise and setting is locked
				can have small selective premise such as character background
			elements given different visuals and mechanics
			plots
				start, action in middle, ending
				all three react to player
		want to simulate both
			problem with trying to do
				good story craft beads collectively
					character arcs, interest curves, rate of informatino delivered
				allow player to interact in arbitary sequence then order will be scrambled and random
			cognitorial explosion
				lot more choices to keep track of
			endings adapt poorly to middle path scenerio
				in story machine, there isn't a singular ending to talk about
			fast and urn alternative experiences
				game with multiple endings, you'll want to play again to find different ending
				have to balance how fast other endings are accomplised
					too quick no gravitous
					too slow will frustrate and have player redo challenges they've already overcome
			insufficent freeform verbs
				verb: methods to interact with world, procedures
				problem games have freeform verbs within a specific focus
					such things that only pertain to combat whereas story machine would have combat, exploration, etc
			time travel
				impermance of choices 
					reset from save
		cheap ways to simulate middle path
			not let player think about
				stories you create vary problem solving and surprise
				break rules and have you consider what's possible
			create situations you yourself understand
				more you understand it the better you can express emotions with it
			provide simplicity and transcendence
				take complexity of real situation and make it simpler and give player more power than they had
					medieval time: can use modern understanding
					future: gives better degree of transcendence
						meeting different species v people, planets v towns
					war: reduce complexity of daily life
						need to beat them before they beat us
					modern world: transcendence feels more applicable to daily lives
					abstract situations: simplify scope and give laser focus to something (ex feeling)
			monomyth
				already proved to kinda give engagement
				trials: makes up 75% of it
			make story punching bag
				bend story make mechanics work
			make story consistent
				if you're bending the story make sure it still makes sense
			make story accessible
				establish what you're building off of
					
				establish twist you've put on it
			angle expectations to player experience
			identify weirdest thing and tie back to it 
		can still use non interactive parts to tell story
			traditional media allows audeience involvement but game needs it
		economic view presence of branching execution paths accounts for what the player
			how obtrusively can you railroad player
		Top Down
			linear rpg, beads on string
		Bottom up 
			feed a bunch of interesting interactions that can happen and player explores them 
	Characters
		special considerations bc we experience through 3rd person view and typically have to perform non-story interactions
		make simple, more external and visual
		take traditional story roles and mapping to game characters
		strong consistent characters provide quality to the story regardless of individual dynamics of play
		Trends
			mental things made physical
				directly express what's happening through visual and sound
				helps players make real time decisions
			less realistic more fantastical 
				takes just as long to make fantastical skeleton as does a real one
			complicated things made simple
				increases range of possible situations
				simple takes less development time
				compllication can give feelings of disempowerment
					character wouldn't do this cause it/he felt like that
		Avatar
			good bc you can kinestically project onto them
			thinking I did rather than he did
		Blank slate
			more character is designed less player can project onto them and feel they are driving the story
		take typical archetype character of story and map them onto specific things that need to happen in game
			hero v hostage: can be physical thing you need to accomplish using mechanics
			mentors, tutors:
			minion, bosses, antagonist: present as challenges player has to overcome
			try to be novel about it by combining, separating, and abstracting different types
		split information by diegetic and non, direct v indirect
		distill characters into lists of versatile traits that can be applied in many situations
			try to make personality, mechanics and narrative tie together
		Intrapersonal Circumplex
			looks really intimidating
			function of two inputs and one output
				Character A and B (when A thinks about B, friendly or hostile), sub or dom
				find position on graph and output is adjective that describes how A thinks about B
		Character Web
			graph that list characters and how related
			proximity inversely proportional to how close they are
			gives most natural way two characters might interact
			way of generating new interactions
		How does status affect them
		Dont underestimate voice and face
			allow distinct voice so they feel more real
		Allow characters to transform
		Avoid uncanny valley
			people like things more the more anthrmorphized they are 
			linear relationship where things are very human but not quite human where you dip down (uncanny valley) and get negative response before you pull back up on other side
				clouds, animatronic mascots, cgi movies (polar express)
				happens when you characters are almost lifelike but something prevents them from fully hitting the peak of realism
