** Working with Animation** 

animation trigger 

*Unity*
Key frame and Events
Uncompress an image: filter mode->point
can change how fast an animation is, can  create a speedMultiplier in the animator, useful in skeletal animation to prevent sliding on the ground
mirror should change direction of time such as pulling something out and then putting it back in
	Sprite Animation:
		Series of images played together, uses sprite sheets
		contains no interpolation
		in the animations folder -> thing that looks like 3 boxes with lines opens animator and allows you to set animations with actions
		put animation on top of something rather animation controlling behaviors 
		Make character walk up or down: 
			set layer as default state (such as idle animation)
			need script (see bottom) 
				in parameters in animator, click plus and add (ex. yVelocity) whatever variable you put in script
			right click on default, make transition and point where you want
				unclick on has exit time
				transition duration 0 since we're working with sprites (helps transition smoothly with skeletal)
				set condition to be what you need, this case walk up is when yVelocity is greater than zero
				make bunch of transitions that dictate what's going
					don't put just 0 if working with floats, just put something like 0.1
					
*Blender* (can use portable verison install) 
tab: edit mode or change to object mode
scroll: in and out
1-7 change views
Spcae: search through commands
A: select all
T: move up 
Alt R: reset skeleton
Middle mouse button: locks in axis you're scaling on
will swap .L and .R put on name of things when using symmetry 
ALT H: unhide everything in animation
	Skeletal Animations:
		don't define every pose, use unity to interpolation
		create faces on mesh: extrude, scale, extrude, scale over and over again
		Face select: extrude (e), scale it up and down (s), grab it (g), rotate (r)
		can use symmetry action
		subdivide: cuts face in two (ex. to make legs)
		give skeletal animation (armature)
			gonna extrude the armature
			start with root bone, looks like tail going into the body
			grow it throughout the body 
		mesh follow model: object mode, click on mesh, shift click armature, crt p, armature deform with automatic weights
		weight painting: controls how much other things around the skeleton move, shows how strongly that bone affects the mesh
		Animation:
			Diamond->Dope Sheet->Action Editor
				position how you want
			Record button or buttons A, I, Location Rotation & Scale
				deslect to see everything in the animation tab
			Interpolation mode: bessier 
		Forward Animation and Inverse Kinematics:
			For every limb you add inverse kinematics
				Inverse Kinematics need not be parented to anything other than the root bone in order to keep track of it
				Need pole
				Pose mode
				grab bone and the bone with the chain link. Add bone constraint and i or look for it 
					Point to target and pole target
						pole faces direction its going to bend
				change chain length
					chain length is how many bones the inverse kinematics is allowed to use (2 bc it can use itself and the shoulder)
		Hit shield button to save
		File->export as->fbx
	Unity with Skeletal:
		Place in unity
		click and drag right into scene 
		Loop time and pose
		Add animator controller 
			can grab bones in unity 
			Drag animations imported in from fbx and drag into animator controller 

//animation script example
public Animator animator;
private float yVelocity;
//update
if(Input.GeyKey(KeyCode.UpArrow)
	this.yVelocity = 1f;
else if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.DownArrow)
	this.yVelocity = -1f;
else
	this.yVelocity = 0f;

animator.SetFloat("yVelocity", this.yVelocity);
