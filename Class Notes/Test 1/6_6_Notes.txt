**Working with Unity**
easy to make platform style game world 
2018.3f2
Game tab in relation to a camera 
Scene view, entire simulation
Inspect tab gives you everything about the object
Typically have folders in Assets, don't usually put things in the root folder
Leave .META files alone

Things are Game Object, Scripts are the behaviors
RMB, create empty, F2 dialog box to rename things or in inspector tab
Find a sprite: download image, drag into Assets 
Inside player, create sprite render and drag image into it
Collider: box collider 2d,add component, want bounds of box to be as tight as possible
Make ground: 
	create 3d cube, (2d and 3d don't interact with each other),take off 3d collider and add 2d, click on cube and qwerty is quick access tools 
	T lets you control square shape object: resize box visual
Moving: 
	Change it over time: add component, simple name like mover, new script, create and add, 
		opens to generic unity script
		start runs right when object appears in world 
		Update is called once per graphical frame
		Input is a static class in the unity engine that give yes or no
	Tie change into input from user: 
	Position, velocity: use Vector3 "name" 
	Vector3.right gives 1.00
	crtl + b to build 
	atomic data types: serializable, bool, integers, float, string  will show up in inspector
	tinker with value in speed to change frame rates
	unity doesn't save values if you change during simulation 
Gravity: 
	Physics engine 
	Rigid body, typical body used to interact with physics engine
	Shift click all objects instead of doing it individually and add rigid body 
	Lock the ground, 
	
Theory 
	prefab: object that we treat as assest, throw in assest folder and allows you to make a lot of copies of an object, a change to the prefab changes all those copies from the prefab
	this refers to the script you are working on 
	this.gameobject points to game object its associated to 
	this.transform is where positions are stored 
	Fixed Update: fires every physics frame, changing physics things, want it to change at the same interval regardless of frame rate, doesn't play well with input class
	Update: every graphical frame, changing graphics and getting fixed input 
	input from update save it to a variable and then actually move it in fixed update
	
	mess with varibles in inspector by making it public which lets you mess with things while the simulation is moving 
	null reference exception: pointer that isn't pointing to anything, so make the variable public and assign in inspector or inside of start create myFloats = new List<float>(); if its private 
	member extraction: click and drag or hitting the bullseye 
	
	graphics go left to right and down, like reading a book
	mappable keys, would need to look up
	GameObject is the toolbox for finding objects in the game
	var lets you put something on the right hand side and automatically asigns said type to the left hand size 
	Instatiate: creates gameobject 
	
	lefthanded coord system: point thumb in position, it will rotate where you fingers point
	z is into the screen 
	Create an object like person and put all the objects that make it up into that object
		lets you rotate and scale everything all at once
