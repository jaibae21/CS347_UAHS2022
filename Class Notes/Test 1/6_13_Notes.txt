**Tetrad con**
Inscribed Aesthetics: 
	the screen, sound data, don't typically encounter taste or smell, goals-want particalur mood through low light, claustrophic hallways, slow movement
	Visuals: everything a person sees when they load up the game 
		box art, loading screens, can be used as anti piracy method, i.e you wont see something and can't continue 
		can have multiple mediums
		rastoration: view port of 3d model made into pixels
	Sound: sound effects draw you into the world more (horse walking sound), instanteously deliever information such as if you've hit something or can interact 
		dialogue: concrete, fast, can help you really get a point across, highest information density 
		Music
	Touch, Smell, and Taste: more common in table top games and such, however rumble controllers better for approximate information gives idea to if you're doing something correctly
		Touch doesn't get annoying if used to give same signal over and over again
	Aesthic Goals: 
		Mood: faster but more delicate than mechanics, no objective logical theory 
		Information: boss tracks, fictional states such as motifs popping up for a certain scenerio 
Inscribed Narrative: 
Follows same way you would break it down in an English class
	Components:
		premise: what sets the fictional world apart from outs, using dialog (ex star wars openings)
		setting: fictional space the game takes place, informs what the character is capable of and technology around them
		characters: people who have agency within a story
		plot: how the characters react to themselves and setting
	Dramatics: 
		Traditional Structure: Five act, important climax happens right in the middle, follows a typical story (ex romeo & juliet) 
			big important event happens right in the middle that puts everyone on a path
		Three Act: built around one single climax, built around single protagonist so when they do something exciting you also feel excited, gives you a kinda expectation since setup is "boring", inciting incident is where the characters everyday life is disrupted, 1st plot point something you can't return from; can apply to dialogue, actions etc
			typically the 3 acts happen in a different location 
			Act 2: "road of trials"
			Act 3: hit their lowest point, then revelation = climax, 
				denoumont is super fast, kinda like welp you did you the end
			Can apply to every instance of time
		Ja-Ha-Kyu: very quick, think cowboy stand off, (ex.quick reload), useful for animation 
	Interactive vs Linear: main plot vs side quests
		beads on a string: preserve illusion of control, choices that feel different. 
		Two options that split and then reconvene, reference something that happens later helps give the illusion 
	Character vs Avatar: Character already exists in the game world vs avatar is created, you are nameless
	Narrative Goals: emotional evokeness, motivation and justification like a scale exchanging freedom of backstory for justification, reinforce the mechanics (abstract)
Inscribed Technology:
	Dynamic behavior, strong interplay with mechanics

**Dynamic Layer**
	Player Role: dynamic layer doesn't exist without
		player feels things at different times which influences time of game and they also have unique expereinces with the game
		different reasons for sitting down and starting a game (emotional motivation) which introduces chaos
		introduce atypical mentalities, throwing games, or doing things outside of expected gameplay
	Emergence: can be previewed with playtest
		can't look at all the rules of the game and see how everything is going to interact
		playtest also helps tell you how much data one can store in their brain
		developer responsible for emergent behavior
	Mechanics:
		Procedures: 
			buttons you press, decisions that match with what goal we're trying to achieve
		Meaningful Play: 
			assigment of subjective weight to player actions and strategic weight to their goals
			needs discernable effect on aesthtics
			integrated andrognously meaningful, needs influence on outcome of game
			meaningful actions needed for engagement
		Strategy: 
			cuts down on number of decisions needed to make to reach goal
			optimal strategy exists for any pursuit of a goal
			benefit over standard play, no goal is standard play
			brain power for said strategy?, more mentally taxing than standard play
			too much design for strategic play creates a barrier to entry to playing the game like with fighter games with mulitple combos and cause conflicting goals, can be mentally taxing
			Need balance- depth (how much mechanical complexity to the dynamic strategy there is) with fighter games is like adding new characters to the roster with different skills, complexity is how many inscribed mechanics someone has to keep track of. Both are brute force methods that can keep a user interestered 
			First Order Optimal: 
				low mental effort with good reward
				causes reliance and monotony and can later cause difficulty spikes because you didn't learn anything at the easier point which can cause people to quit game
				they are not bad, easy way to get feet wet for like an mmo but want to make sure to ween people off of it. 
		House Rules: 
			culturally or dynamically imposed rules, implied or explicit
			can be done between people or on yourself such as choosing to not use a specific weapon or ability 
			one hitting and running and letting time run out (winning by technacality) 
			hiuse rules becoming inscribed (Aram becoming a thing)
		Player Intent: 
			what a player wants to do in a game
			socializers, explorers, killers, achievers are the general archtypes along with cheaters and spoilsports (bad actors)
			can't control intentions but can control type you attract
			spoilsport act within rules of game but don't follow mechanics in order to frustrate others
			bad actors come from the game, some reasons being if they feel skill needed to acheive a goal is unbalanced. Spoilsport enabled by dynanmic behavior so they are developer responsible
			many cheaters are from killer archtype so gets bad rep
		Outcomes: 
			results of actions and resolutions of mechanics. Quests, immediate, final goal, cumulative
			lot of games today have no end goal so people will keep playing
	Aesthic: only seen when game is on (diablo minimap)
		Composite: things created as result of independent systems, enabled by inscribed technology and aesthtics
		Procedural: specific end states you want composite state to end up in 
			more purposeful, 
			music - used as signaling 
			visuals - movement controlled with inverse kinematics: say where you want a foot to be and it auto calculates angle and what not, lights and shadows (there is an inscribed verison)
				Tesselation: getting farther from something reduces the detail you can see (level of detail)
		Environmental: not game but environment around player (having the lighting slider to help you see based on your own lighting or lack of),
			what ambient noise is around you as you play
			changing game for disabilities (color lookup table)
