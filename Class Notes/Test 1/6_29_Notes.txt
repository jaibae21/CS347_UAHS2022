**Ch.1
Talked about what exactly a game was
	be able to match situations with game definition, players not having good time bc its frustrating and relates to much to real life matches with 4
	1: overcome unecessary obstacles, pong, Dungeons and Dragons, asteriods, fallen out cause of things like minecraft
	2: interesting decision, oppurnity cost, predictable not guaranteed outcomes
		capacity for prediction determines if its a game
	3: structured conflict and resolves uncertaint in an unequal outcome, not getting bored bc of predictablility
	4: playful attitude, didn't want something to be a game then not being game in the middle of the game, LoL
	5: agents compete by making ambiguous endogenously meaningful decisions, clarify scope, ex pokemon healing
	Common: want structure, excitement, novelity, mental stimulation, escapism 
Iterative design
	combat emergence
	gradual skill growth, low skill floor high ceiling
	randomness needs to be fun
	allow unknown to exist because its fun to interact with
	player rest (cut scene, 
	change only one thing at a time
**Ch.2
Game Frameworks
	MDA
		playtest focused emphasis on humans
		players experience mechanics which create dynamics and then aesthetics, developers do it backwards
		things on game disc, exist when player isn't playing
		dynamics is what happens or appear when the players are playing
			metagame is the dynamics, affects how different players approach the game, ex being a healer like Sona expected to run around and heal all players
		aesthetics are emotional response, short(jump scares) and long term(working up to max hits)
	FDD
		information driven, academically analyze game
		formal how we break apart the game, crosses over with game theory
		dynamic everything that happens at runtime 
			strategy, metagame
		dramatic everything that happens in the story, crosses with literature 
	Elemental Tetrad
		not typically used since less depth when we have layered tetrad
**Ch.3
	basically preview of ch 4, 5, 6
	lose control as you go through layers
	dyanmic and cultural is where non players experience the game
	social games like jackbox need locked in inscribed layers 
**Ch.4
	everything is purposely placed in here that is in there
	mechanics = code, objectives,
