**Unity basics cont. **
User interfaces: 2d plane overlayed, 
	UI->canvas: always overlay over top of game, always exist a certain distance away from camera, worldspace canvas-useful repository
		canvas already big which makes it out of the way
		screenspace over, stay in one place
		don't delete event system object, takes care of when you interact with said things
		button has access to any public function
		inputfield.value to get text 
		anchor points: any UI, click little square, want to anchor to edge of screen, typically dont want the UI to deform
		speed*Time.deltaTime    helps so that the speed at which something updates or move: time it took to render last graphical frame
		time.fixedDeltaTime: same thing but for physics engine, not as useful as you can't write to it and always says 0.02
		Position vs Velocity:
		can do math in inspector
		Trigger: will make something fall through scene/ground, OnTriggerEnter2D
			two triggers can't collide
		Collisions: 2d/3d, Collider x Collider or Collider x Trigger
		Goes over menu making

** Layered Tetrad ** 
Inscribed: on game disk (text, music, animation)
Dynamic: single player/person sitting playing game
	emergence: what makes game design hard, idea of game having a small set of rules but when they interact there are multiple states that could happen that you can't predict
		cause game crashes, or end up moving strategy in a certain way
	aesthitics: procedural art and physical strain: the feedback you get from playing the game (holding the controller in a weird way to run and move camera)
Cultural: multiple players or exists outside game
	social media, memes, fan-art
	gaining a weapon that then becomes the new new player weapon 
	cheat engines, gameplay mods, game walkthroughs
	fan mods that added quests, news stories on (ex violent games or sensitive content)
	if you created the game you can't interact with the cultral layer 
Things can always be traced down the layers but not always up. (ex. fortnite dances and toys)

**Inscribed Layer**
FDD
Mechanics: 
	what you wanna do, tools you have, and methods you use on tools
objectives: 
	what am I trying to do, methods by which I have to win or meet goal, 
	immediacy:
		guides player moment to moment actions (short), reflect fictional premise or mechanical ruleset(getting a certain lvl or amount of money) (long), order short goals (mid-term)
	Importance: 
		High- usually deal with survival and achieving capstones (ex. almost everything in a fighting game), Mid-goal seeking setup for success, low-combination of caution and optimization
	Conflict: 
		managing a set of resources, risk v reward, vs other players, unequal objectives = asymmetrical gameplay, conflicting objectives = competition 
Inscribed player relationships: 
	Interaction: way game is played (single, player v environment, battle royale)
	Actor Roles: other players, npcs. Protagonist, competitor, collaborator, citizen
		people tend to play around with their roles
Inscribed spaces: 
	navigable environments, 
	purpose- why they are there 
	flow-way in which you travel;can change moment to moment play;unlocks you new things, 
	landmarks-specifically designed to stick out in player's head;gives you approximate bearings especially if you haven't unlocked that part of the map, 
	experiences-finding a new ability, what players are expected to do;finding a boss battle;what happens because you are in the space, 
	induced objectives-changing objectives based on new environment you encounter
Inscribed Tables: 
	how we describe any data structure, encounter table, progression tables, crosses the most with technology
Inscribed Mechanics Misc: 
	rules- how fast you move;to beat game need to beat boss
	boundaries-no using monoply money to pay for real things; boundary of where something has meaning in the relation to a game vs reality (border of play)
	ARG (alternate reality) random phone numbers in game that you could call with your phone, 
	resources- assets that you can gain or lose during the game, attributes which are static over time such as having mana or being a demon hunter so you use both bow and sword/dagger
