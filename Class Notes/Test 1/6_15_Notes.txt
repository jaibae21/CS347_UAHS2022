**Dyanmic layer Cont**

	Narrative: how we interact with the story
		State Influence:
			players abiltiy to change how the story is going, usually through destruction like death
			causes combinatorial explosions such as two of the same npcs
			done through choosing between two actions
			can be tied to mechanical abitlites but reduces nuance of the character
				have dimensions to the character so in order to be in best mechanical state have to go to one or the other extreme
		Multiple Endings:
			usually through decisions
			promienet in games with character progression or conversation
				branches in conversation
			used as a mechanical tool
		Shared Experience:
			dynamic and cultural layer
			social bonding that happens when you and another set out to complete a task
			social ordeal of how two people problem solve
				bomb game, fps, mmo raids
			also done in competitor games
	Technology:
		runtime behavior and performance of game
		code responsibily, Murphy's Law


**Cultural Layer**
Exists beyond play
	Mechanics:
		Mods:
			new assests, earliest form of independent scene
			other games can come from these
			ROM Hacks change the way the assests show up
			Plugins are usually helpful, open the game from software secruity view, 
			Official Support for mods which helps create nonintefering things, makes plugins safe and authorized channel
		Custom Levels:
			similar to game mods but in cultural view different
			maker type games and now are provided within games
				Super Mario maker
		Diff in dyanmic and cultural
			Speed running idea is cultural but developers can take the idea and put it in the game making it inscribed
	Aesthetics
		Fan Art:
			visual media that draws from narrative and aesthetics, and even the dyanmic layer
			people make new cultural layer around itself
				pairing up characters that usually don't
		Cosplay:
			large investment of time and money usually seen at face meetup 
			typically inscribed art or significant cultural elements
				other elements such as gui
		Gameplay as Art:
			looks at inscribed mechanics
			skilled player going through mechanics in an impressive or pleasing way
			voluntary or involuntary, don't have to be trying sometimes just happens
	Narrative
		can't be distributed on its own unless its something like fanfiction
		narrative game mods like adding more quests
		experienced over time
		instantaneous and direct sharing
		machinima making game look cinematic as possible but characters just slightly moving their head
			offically supported modes now for taking pictures and such
	Technology
		cost of game, how its distributed
		what montiors the progress
		use of game engines for simulation and game AI
		use of player behavior for sociological study
		microtransaction perception going from smaller purchases to bigger ones
			passes
		Computer generated environments,
			subservice scattering how light reacts to surfaces (Ex. finger over light)
			ray tracing (cuts down on lighting operations needed, render what you need)
		gaming hardware
		Can change the inscribed layer (mods)
		can change dynamic
			tutorials and guides
			screen adjustments such as blue light filter
			mapping tools that can give the map ahead of time
			dps calculators
			api based tools, exposed server that developers have created
				affecting server which affects the game
			wallhacks and aimbots
	authorized transmedia is not part of the cultural layer, a fan has to make it
		want it to come from the players that interact with it
		if it comes from an ip holder then it becomes another inscribed layer
			star wars media, star wars games both have their own inscribed layer, (reinscription)
	Impact of Videogame
		influences players and everybody else
		considering player by optimizing
			driving prompt in pokemon go
		develop positive skills
			situation awareness, multitask, co-op, physical (wii with wii sports or just dance for elderly) and mental therapy, reaction speed and problem solving, muscle coordination
		negative habits
			specifics
				addiction and loss of productivity 
					exaberate when the fear of missing mechanics happens on the opposite end is having daily quests and such so that you log in at least once to play
				toxic social behavior
					anomity and ability to be mean then you will probably be toxic
				predatory chance mechanics 
					same gratification casinos run on
					loot box games, gacha
					selling acounts with rare or hard to get things 
			broadly
				elitism, exacerbation of existing conditions, propaganda (tying real life political movements into the mechanics), desensitization to violence (controversy, exposed more to makes us more ok with it)
		Messages in Mechanics
			way coins are setup in mario64, implies following coins is good
			attach mechanical rewards to actions or social behaviors
				honors in league
				trying to get a player to quit so your team wins
			forced to experience frames of reference
				being told to do something seemed more good, you would go beyond your consciouness than choosing to do something on your own (consciouness stops you at some point)
				easy way out with authority or choose your consciouness
			frequency implies normality
				creating implications in your game, such as darker skinned characters always being your enemy and lighter skinned always your friend
				happens when not enough playtest is done by people who can't relate back what the game might be trying imply
