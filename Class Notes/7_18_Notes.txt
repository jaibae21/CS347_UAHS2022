** From final review ** 
Not much on paper prototyping besides what its good and bad for

GameTesting:
	understand why we need playtesters
	what area might you fall short in or do better in as a playtester given your background in games
	
	





** Quiz Results **
Brainstorming process creates intersectional innovations
	book is centered around idea that we take alot of ideas, shovel them around, and cause ideas that don't normally coexist to collide
	incremental is more taking in factors like RAM, hardware
performative empowerment
	need to establish type what performance or intended play is designed for game and how the mechanics empower that

**Paper Prototyping (9)**
form of early prototyping, by creating a facsimile of the game
	instead of executable, we act as the game engine using props
Allows us to easily change mechanics (iterate)
	easily see new emergence
Good for turn based elements and wild ideas
Bad for high memory systems and real time feedback


	Baseline advantages:
		development and iteration speed
			quick to add or remove elements
		low technical knowledge
			allows for collaboration from all areas
	Composite advantages:
		allows everyone on team to prototype what the game is going to look like
		have set of tests that focuses on the mechanics 
			more fruitful things to iterate on and improve on than tiny details
			you know details aren't set in stone so you don't nick pick them
	Items needed
		Large piece of paper
			large enough for play space
				strategy, big whiteboard
				need distances to be measured for attacks and such, want graph or hex paper
		Dice
			sub for random number generation
			cards also substition
		Cards
		Card sleeves
			protects cards and keeps uniformity
			easy to mark
				ex. quick changes to the rules
		Notecards and Scissors
			paper representations, write things down
		Post its
			notetaking and easily affix text to something
		Whiteboard
			added benefit of erasing things easily
		Pipe cleaner and Lego blocks
			create 3d representation of things
		Notebook
			help gather information while someone is playing the game
			can gather nonverbal reactions/indicators
	Examples
		GUIs:
			Menus - postit notes, users should find options intuitively
				better for usecase study, help make sure how things are categorized are intuitive
			Overlays - group related items, less pertinent information the furthest from the middle of the screen
				ensures consistent style and coloration among related elements
		Maps and Traversal
			usability testing of physical environment
			Geography
				instead of entire game world, layout it out 2d using paper prototyping 
				ensures users understand where to go from cues and that no unwinnable situations exist
					bad bc it forces players to restart
			prototype movement
				indicate certain areas that can only be taken conditionally
				player explore to obtain items for final desitnation
				backtracking is not egregious and that application pairings are obvious
					locks and keys
	Playtesting
		paper prototype fails to deliver on certain dynamics (harder for MDA approach)
			fails to suprise someone
		real time reactions are not the same
			bc more of a description of what's happening
		artisitic minutiae
			harder to pick up on details, or a pattern with a monster
		gravitas
			not able to tell something is important because you just have scribbles on paper
			not accurate presentation of how story affects
		questions to ask
			paths players are taking
				understand first instinct and align with intended play
					intution is rewarded
			where/how player get stuck
				stuck generally can lead to boredom which we want to avoid
			exploration/navigation fun
				if its fun to explore things in your game then that game should be about exploration
				horror game, shouldn't try and make navigation fun
	Use it for
		understanding movement through space, compact and large
		scope limited systems
			how someone does attacks in turn based rpg
			how someone spends money
		how information is laid out and how eye looks for things
			makes procedures smoother
		wild ideas
			whole level is a boss
			out there idea for rule, concept
	Should use for
		tracking lots of information
				humans aren't as consistent in calculations
			large scale simulations
			damage taken or mitigated
			things with vast lookup tables
		gauging behavior overtime and distance
			rythm  and pace of play is differnet
			decisions will be accepted instantly in paper prototyping 
		understanding physical objects
			can't tell if its difficult to run and move camera at the same (controller)
	Summary
		lightweight, low overhead, better for overall collaboration
		tabletop games is basically the idea of paper prototyping



** Formal Methods in Game Testing (10) ** 
Playtesting is inviting criticism and hard but necessary
gives outside perspectives on product and shows difficultly curves, if proper conveyance is given, and if it presents the information in an easily remembered way (teaching tools)
	Circles of PlayTesters
		You(designer)
			person who see design elements evolve from infancy to final forms
			incabable of creating accurate first impression
				helicopter parent, biased
				can't gauge difficulty curves, if it does proper conveyance
			biased by back-end knowledge and idea of the game that exists in your mind
				gives warped thinking of whats important and should be updated/fixed next
		Trusted friends
			put in front of people you know aren't afraid to hurt your feelings
			people you communicate with well, clearly and unambiguously
			target members that are also in the game design business
				someone that break it down in MDA
				relate it back to other games, and game mechanices
			best subjective feedback
		Acquaintances and others
			associated with but not friends with
				going to a gamestop in the mall or a game-con
				going to a university and having randoms playtest it
			used to generate first impressions
			first group to imitate the real world feedback 
			final circle where you expect to be face to face with audience
		Internet, Anyone
			throwing game to mass market and having anyone play
			need automated survey, or have built in to game information (where they go, how do it, other performance data), anonoymity 
			requires good data-gathering practices to get useful information
	Methods of Playtesting
		Informal Individual 
			when you walk up to some random and ask them to play or having a friend play a game on your phone
				very little lead up 
			can fit in any type of time and place budget
			lot less pressure to withdraw from playing if they don't like it
			don't tell player too much
				such as how to get past a level, puzzle
				loses feedback if you do
			don't lead player
				backseat playing
			dont argue or make excuses
				if they say animation is bad or something, don't make excuses for it
				makes them less likely to raise such criticisms later
			take notes
				what the actual feedback is
				who played it, where it was played, when it was played
					identify environmental aesthetics
				(fi you have good read on the person) note underlying issue and severity, and propose a solution when they note a problem
		Formal Individual
			most academic overlap with CS
				need to more objectively pros and cons for reason something was created
			deep dive into a particular person's experience
			more time and commitment agreement 
			developers take care to simulate typical gameplay environment and remove all bias
			playtester takes care to concentrate, analyze, and deliver unambiguous feedback so developer can understand what's being said
			Procedure: 
				set up a lab
					place with few distractions
				welcome playtester, thank for time
				run the test, record the game screen, player actions and inputs, face experissions, audio from thinking out loud
					log data somewhere permanent
				thank playtester and ask for misc. feedback
					background thoughts or anything not related to maybe what was going on right then
				syncronize and analyze data streams
		Formal group
			lot of time and money
			hard to coordinate
			need good data management
			whole bunch of people run through parallized playtest
			good source of high volume useful feedback
			scripts used to synchronize testers dealing with isolated groups
				how to pull off usability studies
			method for large development houses
				blizzard, EA, Ubisoft
					usually specific date and speed they want game down, so its a way to save time by spending money
		Online
			crowdsourcing a group 
			differing levels of crowds
				closed: certain number of invites
				limited: also closed but like can bring plus 1
				open: anyone and everyone
					more for server stability, hardware feedback
			large volume of feedback
			most difficult to get meaningful information on
				telementary purposes: what character/weapon is picked most, spend money on, npcs talked to
	Specific Types of Testing
		Marketabiltiy tests
			focus testing
				asking if the game appeals to them
			interest polling
				ask if there are different things you want to try that interest them
		Gameplay tests
			usability
				ask someone to do something using interface and see if its natural and intutitve
			QA
				see if bugs pop up or gameplay errors
			Automated
				map loading: send AI controlled people all over map 
	Be better playtester
		think out loud
			putting words to things you feel
			stream of consciouss style talking
				provides accurate timeline of feedback
		reveal your biases
			such as if you play a lot of certain genre
		self analyze 
			such as if you experience a certain feeling and what causes it
			if bias are causing an atypical feeling
		separate elements
			animation is bad, but try to deliver more descriptive feedback
				model jerks, center of gravity feels off, momentum comes out of nowhere, animation too fast in comparison to another time or frame
		don't try and please developers
			giving all the feedback you have
				when you don't want to do something, struggle with another, did something else not very well


** Guiding the Player **
guide the player in what to do and how well they are doing it
direction is any element that tries to alter the way a player plays the game
	narrator, arrows, npcs
	Direct instruction
		directly addressing the player when pertinent
			immediacy
				how close is the instruction to what you need to act
			scarcity
				how often do you tell the player, less better to make moment stand out
			brevity
				how much time and space needed to give information, less better bc easier to remember
			clarity
				how clear, why they are doing
			brevity and clarity conflic with each other
				can brute force either by adding or removing word count of instruction
		Instructions
			using text, audio, or images that say specifically what to do
				element based things
				can set characterization, mood, 
			text should be unobtrusive
				perform a task with text given, should be able to see both
			audion best devliered diegeticaly
				instead of narrator popping up, best if character in game does the talking
			images need good graphic design principles
		Call to Action
			inform tha player overall game mechanically and story wise
			typically overarching goal, with mini objectives
			incorporates 3 or 5 act story structure, especially 3 act
		Map/Guidance system
			symbolic marker directions on how to navigate 2 or 3d space, telling where you are, need to be, possibly path to get there
			best for large spaces with sparce guidance
			overuse incentivizes blind marker following, can cause non-engagement with narrative
			should be used sparingly, general instruction, don't want player blinding following
		Pop Ups
			contextual media that appears to give instruction to current situation, highly pertinent info
			immediate and obtrusive or general and unobstrusive
			quick time events can be considered popups
				entire genre out of it micro games
	Indirect instruction
		game design artistry
		directing play by hiding influence within ambient design factors
		negative methods
			remove elements
				focus camera on something specifically with exclusion to other things
		positive
			adding elements that lead the player somewhere
				put princess on other side of dragon, meaning you need to fight it
		constraints
			conspicuous absence of design elements or possibility space
				running right in mario brothers, try left runs into wall, which teaches you to only go right
			gameplay space is culled to punish or disincentivize the perusal of suboptimal play
			helps guide player choice toward what they should do through variety, depth, and interest
				stimulating things to engage with mentally give voluntarily action to interact with
				making you run towards the camera if there is something to outrun behind you
					good indication of what the level is about to do
		physical interface
			use of periphals to suggest what someone should and shouldn't do
				5th button on guitar for gutiar hero
			negative
				physical discomfort, mutual exclusion - not scoping and melee attacking at same time
			positive
				rumble strips
		camera
			negative method
			visually exclude something
				causes player to focus
					explicit focus
						game fly through on mario 64
					implicit focus
						giving player the idea that nothing below the camera is important, fixed camera
			elements of contrast
				brightness: players typically go towards light
				Texture: change the way something looks texturally for hints on where to go
				color: same as texture
				directionality: the way the lines are heading/intersection with other lines 
				Ex. carpet on the floor going in one direction, but not all over the floor
		Goals
			use of inherent or generated goals
			sequencing
				placing something you want but an enemy near it
			foreshadowing
				have something to build up to then pay off
				seeing a dragon at the beginning and knowing later when you reach that area you'll get to fight that dragon
			expansion
				content beyond reach in early game areas
				forces player to explore later game areas
		player avatar
			how the avatar is shaped and what they hold imply how game should be played
			visually: bulk and sturdiness imply proximity and exporsure to danger
			characters expectede to employ tools they carry
			use their mechancial design to reward and guide players to greater challenges
				healing, bonus xp, 
		NPCs
			stand in for the world and add intent
			can communicate how appropriate the player's behavior is
				Assasin's creed hiding in crowds
			act as trial runs to show how to perform certian actions
				show what would've happened if so and so happened
			can generate contrast and direction through scarcity
				no npcs but they show up when stuck on something
					such as one showing up as a guide for a level
		Audio Design
			long term
				set tone of scene
			short term
				interacting with something you can't or shouldn't
				signify states such as grounded or in a state to perform next or different action
				tell hits
		Visual Design
			Light
				humans naturally drawn to light
				both long term or instanteneous alerts
				indication of where to go
			Similarity
				visually similiar objects probably have the same associations
					rubies marked a color which correspond to gold or xp gaining
			Trails
				gatherable items
					creates leap of faith moments
						sonic rings, coins in mario games
			Landmarks
				physical embodiement of contrast
				visually interesting and distinct objects that help orient player
				generate interest
			Arrows
				weighted straigh lines
				if multiple lines can converge that makes the area stand out to player
				not very strong way of guiding players so best used with other things
	Sequencing
		guiding players from being novices to experts
		Isolated introduction
			player introduced to mechanic in simple environment with as many tries as they want
			no distractions and unambiguous instructions
		Expansion
			add additional dimensions to a mechanic
			restrictions loosened
			guidance removed
		Adding Danger
			penalities and danger added so player has to actually solve problems
			provides player with vector to grow and improve
				lets players feel they are improving
		Increased difficulty
			go all out
			make them perform mechanic with harsh conditions to display competentance 
			maximize mechanical complexity
